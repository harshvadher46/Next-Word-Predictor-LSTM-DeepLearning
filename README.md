# So guy's here i made a simple architecture using LSTM(long short term memory) concept of RNN from Deep Learning.
# i just feeded some data and trained a model using it to predict the the next word from the given data 

  # How it works
 # So,Basically in the last term in the text field you have to provide some data or text ehich text's next words you want to predict
 # The Model has an incredible accuracy of " 94% " 
 # You can predict as many word as you want just provide the number inside the first for loop in the last cell of the code itself
